Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Bots are an arbitrage tool that will sniff the Mempool for pending transactions on decentralized exchanges (such as Uniswap or PancakeSwap), and then it will insert our own TX with a slightly higher gas fee, essentially sandwiching the pending TX and forcing ours to be automatically processed first, resulting in massive profit.

🚨 EDIT: I have received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. The Bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower, however nowadays most tokens come with 3~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.2 ETH or less and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will basically waste a lot of gas fees. I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.2 ETH to make sure that won't happen.
